## The problem it solves...

You can check the GitHub stats of anyone right inside your chrome tab. 🥱

Get rid of your old tab and checkout our new Chrome New Tab extension which shows GitHub stats of yours. ❤️‍🔥

## Requirements...

- [Giterang](https://github.com/lostgirljourney/giterang/releases/download/tag/giterang.zip) 💻

## Inspiration...

Our inspiration draws from [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/) Chrome Extension and we thought why don't we show our users their GitHub Stats right on their chrome (new) tab, hence the idea of Giterang came into the existence. 😇

## What it does?

It simply opens up a new tab but just that it makes it more nerd by showing your GitHub Stats. 😎

## How we built it?

- Falguni did **Frontend/UI logic** with which you gonna interact. 👻
- Aniruddha did **JavaScript/UX logic** with which this extension gonna interact. 🤯

## Technologies we used...

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JAVASCRIPT
- JSON
- CHROME EXTENSION

## Challenges we ran into...

Since, Google is gonna discontinue v2, getting what we require was hard, and we are proud of what we made. We wanted to add an authentication but due to time constraints, we couldn't do that. But, we are gonna work on this extension furthermore add more features like notifications etc. 🤞

## Accomplishments that we're proud of...

We are now officially in **"Documentation/Stackoverflow Reader club"**. 😌

## What we learned?

Learnt a new stack and adapted it fully quickly. 😶‍🌫️

## What's next for Giterang Chrome Extension?

We are going to grow it more and will add more features. 🤓

**Enjoy!**
